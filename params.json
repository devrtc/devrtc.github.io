{"name":"Devrtc.GitHub.io","tagline":"The DevRTC GH Pages","body":"DevRTC\r\n=======\r\n###[DevRTC.github.io](//devrtc.github.io): Developing For The Future\r\n\r\n\r\n###One Billion Users, 57% of Enterprise with in development programs, Google and Microsoft leading the same Working Group, Dogs and Cats Living together, the End of the World or an <i>Amazing New Beginning? \r\n\r\n###What is it\r\nPlugin-less in browser rich media communications. Skype, but times a thousand, free, open, not needing plugins. \r\n\r\nStill there will be a need for \"extending on the platform\" but to start this is what people interesting in telecom, VOIP, AV Conferencing and streaming, have waiting decades to hae, Media companies will go to town, Telecom Companies and their politicians, will maybe just have to leave town...because it's free.\r\n\r\n###What is DevRTC?\r\nDevRTC is a series of repos and projects and articles, tutorials and collected resources to help you have a concise singular place to learn and play with the technology. We are developers and media vendors who are fans of the technology, believe in open source, and feel that especially in light of the American Controversy with Net Neutrality and the FTC/FCC/Justice abuses of communications privacy whilst protecting a status quo to digitally enslave large precentages of the North American Population knowing that can't compete on a level playing field. The old Guard is dying not a minute too soon. The top 25 Geo Economies Americas, Western Europe, Asia, have all seen similar abuses of power and VodaFone insists they have no choice but to cooperate even when they know its bullshit. \r\n\r\nWeb RTC is the high quality standard that allows free and easy access to pseudo HD communications voice and video, with collaborative and storage functions to humanity. Making the playing field as big as possible. We may have a future in store of distributed broadcasting, and service fulfillment. The Viewers running Youtube, chatting with each other on any modern connected device independent of programming choices, and the phone, well any unique identifier can serve as a means to get in touch. be it a facebook id, email, or future serial. \"it's been great Bell, Edison, Lucent, but we may have outgrown the phone system entirely we'll take it from here thanks!\"  \r\n\r\n \r\n###Where do you \"get\" it?\r\nYou may already have it. Modern Browsers, not necessarily bleeding edge, thats absurd but any modern Chrome or MOzilla will have most in fact has for some time had most of these technologies. This site and the ones we will be referring to should answer mor equestions than you have the time to ask.\r\n\r\n###The Future\r\n\r\n\r\n###Links\r\n\r\n###What is left to hack?\r\nEverything, standards are a mass, adoption has been slow and in some cases misleading. Microsoft was splintred but now seems to be on track with the agreed upon standards. Who really uses IE 6-8 anyway...  Telecom providers are shovelling 8 bit 16 kHz garbage while dropping all the relevant RTC terms. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
