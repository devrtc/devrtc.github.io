###What is it
Plugin-less in browser rich media communications. Skype, but times a thousand, free, open, not needing plugins.

*Still there will be a need for "extending on the platform" but to start this is what people interesting in telecom, VOIP, AV Conferencing and streaming, have waiting decades to hae, Media companies will go to town, Telecom Companies and their politicians, will maybe just have to leave town...because it's free.

###What is DevRTC?
DevRTC is a series of repos and projects and articles, tutorials and collected resources to help you have a concise singular place to learn and play with the technology. We are developers and media vendors who are fans of the technology, believe in open source, and feel that especially in light of the American Controversy with Net Neutrality and the FTC/FCC/Justice abuses of communications privacy whilst protecting a status quo to digitally enslave large precentages of the North American Population knowing that can't compete on a level playing field. The old Guard is dying not a minute too soon. The top 25 Geo Economies Americas, Western Europe, Asia, have all seen similar abuses of power and VodaFone insists they have no choice but to cooperate even when they know its bullshit.

###Web RTC is the high quality standard that allows free and easy access to pseudo HD communications voice and video, with collaborative and storage functions to humanity. Making the playing field as big as possible. We may have a future in store of distributed broadcasting, and service fulfillment. The Viewers running Youtube, chatting with each other on any modern connected device independent of programming choices, and the phone, well any unique identifier can serve as a means to get in touch. be it a facebook id, email, or future serial. "it's been great Bell, Edison, Lucent, but we may have outgrown the phone system entirely we'll take it from here thanks!"

Where do you "get" it?
